# ART Segmentation

**ART Segmentation** (Agentic Residual Transformer Segmentation) is a novel deep-learning framework designed for robust and accurate ultrasound image segmentation. Our model integrates a cutting-edge Swin Transformer backbone with a specialized segmentation architecture that leverages a Tri Agent Block for dynamic multi-scale feature refinement, along with a semi-supervised learning strategy to effectively leverage small annotated datasets.

## Overview

Ultrasound image segmentation plays a vital role in clinical diagnostics but is challenging due to inherent issues such as low contrast, speckle noise, and limited resolution. **ART Segmentation** addresses these challenges by:

- **Leveraging Transformer-based Feature Extraction:**  
  Utilizing the Swin Transformer backbone, ART Segmentation captures rich contextual information crucial for precise segmentation.

- **Dynamic Feature Refinement:**  
  The novel Tri Agent Block dynamically refines multi-scale features via residual connections and an agentic gating mechanism, enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to delineate object boundaries.

- **Semi-Supervised Learning:**  
  A semi-supervised learning framework is incorporated to exploit unlabeled data, significantly improving performance on small annotated datasets.

## Key Features

- **High Segmentation Accuracy:**  
  Achieves an AUC of 99.89%, an IoU of 89.18%, and a Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 5.60 mm on a challenging ultrasound dataset.

- **Precise Boundary Delineation:**  
  The model excels in capturing precise boundary information, critical for accurate medical image analysis.

- **Efficient Architecture:**  
  Designed to be lightweight and computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time clinical applications.

- **Modular and Extensible:**  
  The framework is implemented in PyTorch and organized into modular components for easy extension and experimentation.

## Architecture

- **Swin Transformer Backbone:**  
  Captures global context and hierarchical features.
  
- **Tri Agent Block:**  
  An evolution from previous quad-agent designs, this block uses three branches to dynamically refine multi-scale features.
  
- **Residual Connections:**  
  Enhance training stability and enable efficient gradient flow.
  
- **Semi-Supervised Learning Module:**  
  Incorporates pseudo labeling to leverage unlabeled data, boosting overall performance.
